####[O maestro, a orquestra e a racionalização das práticas musicais - DISSERTAÇÃO (2015)](https://www.academia.edu/11012264/O_maestro_a_orquestra_e_a_racionaliza%C3%A7%C3%A3o_das_pr%C3%A1ticas_musicais)
This dissertation aims to describe and analyze the modern orchestra development and its internal relations as well as the modern conducting technique development, explaining how this practices evidence the rationalization process as exposed by Weber in his work The rational and social foundations of music. After the presentation of the orchestra and description of its development, we analyzed how it evidences the rationalization of this specific musical practice. The same was done with the modern conducting technique. Then, we analyzed the irrational aspects intrinsic in the gestural choosing process involved in the left hand performance. Finally, one can observe that the three elements that compose the conducting technique – the right hand, the left hand and the facial-bodily expressions – have different rationalization levels.

####[Villa-Lobos: uma manifestação cultural nacional (2012)](https://www.academia.edu/3525478/Villa-Lobos_uma_manifesta%C3%A7%C3%A3o_cultural_nacional)
This article has the objective of analyzing part of the work and the life of Villa-Lobos as a national cultural manifestation observing in his music nationalistic characteristics such as anthropophagic elements, hybridism and agglutination of Brazilian popular rhythms on the construction of an art of national character. After a reflection on the course of the development of the nationalistic thought in European and Brazilian music works, we will also analyze the figure of Villa-Lobos utilized by the Vargas government as nationalistic politic propaganda also giving emphasis to his significance in Brazilian music history and in the evolution of the nationalistic thought in music of Brazil.
